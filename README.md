# uworks

This was my php project during Vanier ACS Web and Database Certificate education.

Today's commit is more for practice git rather than share this little app.

1. July17_command_lines.txt is very good for a starter of github as me.
2. php app can be launch by executing /pages/uworks_landing.php file from PhpStorm.
